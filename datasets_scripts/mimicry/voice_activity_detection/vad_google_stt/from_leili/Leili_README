* For large audio files, you need to store them on google cloud bucket

* You need to do some audio preprocessing before sending it to the service, including converting to mono channel, lossless embedding, sampling rate of 16000. 
This can be done using ** sox ** 

sox -G input.wav --channels 1  --rate 16000 output.flac

In your specific service account, add the following roles: 
Storage Admin; 
Storage Object Admin;
